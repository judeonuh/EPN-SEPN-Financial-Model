### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
___

On the financial model...
- Data was cleaned using 'trim' function to remove trailing whitespaces; 'ifferror' to assign values (0 for numerical columns or "-" for text columns ) to empty cells that may return '#N/A' errors.

> [!Warning]
> On your excel sheet, ensure the number format for the "Name" column is set to "General"
- Using VLOOKUP function, extract the Residual Charging Bands of each customer from their respective data sheets.
- Populate the Import Fixed Charges (IFC) for each customer from 2020 - 2024 using VLOOKUP function.
- Calculate the Annual Fixed Charge (AFC) (in Â£) for each customer by dividing IFC (this is in pence) by 100 and multiplying by 365 or 366 (for a leap year)
