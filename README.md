### Technologies
___
- Microsoft Excel


### Data Sources
___
Datasets for this project was obtained from a data company and files named according to the regions within their power network


### Usage Instructions
___
- Data analysis was performed on Microsoft Excel. Download and install MS Excel on your machine. If you have not already, this software can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/excel?ef_id=_k_7f6ebb9ae2b216bcec3edc83309dd670_k_&OCID=AIDcmmp20rgnjr_SEM__k_7f6ebb9ae2b216bcec3edc83309dd670_k_&msclkid=7f6ebb9ae2b216bcec3edc83309dd670).
- Ensure all data files are located in the same directory and maintain a consistent naming pattern for all files.
> [!WARNING]
> Saving files on an online platform (e.g. OneDrive) could cause any link in the file to load slower, throwing up warning alerts. So, preferrably, save files on desktop or "C Drive"


### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
___

On the financial model...
- Data was cleaned using 'trim' function to remove trailing whitespaces; 'ifferror' to assign values (0 for numerical columns or "-" for text columns ) to empty cells that may return '#N/A' errors.
- To get the names of customers on the "Name" column for each sheet, link/extract this from their respective data sheets.
> [!Warning]
> On your excel sheet, ensure the number format for the "Name" column is set to "General"
- Using VLOOKUP function, extract the Residual Charging Bands of each customer from their respective data sheets.
- Populate the Import Fixed Charges (IFC) for each customer from 2020 - 2024 using VLOOKUP function.
> [!WARNING]
> For quick retrieval of the IFC: After using VLOOKUP for the first IFC column, say 2020_IFC, copy the formular for this column into the next column, say 2021_IFC. Next, naviagte to the formular bar on this column and change the year accordingly - in this case, from 2020/21 to 2021/22.
> Repeat same for every column. This way, the model allows you to extract any customer's IFC for any year by just editing the year on the formular bar.
- Calculate the Annual Fixed Charge (AFC) (in Â£) for each customer by dividing IFC (this is in pence) by 100 and multiplying by 365 or 366 (for a leap year)
- Calculate the Year-on-Year percentage change on AFC using the formular "(current year AFC/ previous year AFC)-1"
- Summarise data using pivot table and chart

### Data Analysis and Discussion
___


### Replicating Model
___

To replicate this model for any new Network/region of customers...
- Create a copy of your model and rename this copy as the new Network/region
- Delete all the records presently on the new sheet EXCEPT the first 5 records.
- Change the links for any chosen cell. By doing this, the model extracts data from the new linked data sheet without the need for formulars again.
- To edit links...
  -  Go to "Data" Tab, click on "Edit Links".
  -  From the opened dialogue box, select the new data sheet you want and click on "Change Source".
  -  Click "Close" when finished.
  -  Select all records and fill downwards
- Refresh any Pivot table connected to your data
> [!CAUTION]
> It is recomended to break all links before exporting or sharing your model with others, for security reasons.
> Go to "Data" Tab, click on "Edit Links", select all links and click "Break link".
> NOTE: Broken lnks can not be undone!
